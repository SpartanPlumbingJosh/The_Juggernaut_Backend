# Elite Manus AI Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Elite Manus AI system to Digital Ocean.

## Overview

The Elite Manus AI system consists of two main components:
1. Frontend - React-based user interface
2. Backend - Core engine with conversational AI capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Digital Ocean account
- GitHub repository with the Elite Manus AI codebase
- Docker installed locally for testing

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Frontend Deployment

1. Push the code to your GitHub repository
2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build the frontend
3. Deploy to Digital Ocean App Platform:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the frontend directory
   - Choose a static site deployment
   - Configure build command: `npm run build`
   - Set output directory: `dist` or `build`
   - Deploy the application

### 2. Backend Deployment

1. Push the code to your GitHub repository
2. The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build the backend
3. Deploy to Digital Ocean App Platform:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select the backend directory
   - Choose a service deployment
   - Configure build command if needed
   - Set environment variables for API keys and configuration
   - Deploy the application

### 3. Connecting Frontend to Backend

1. Set the backend API URL in the frontend environment variables
2. Redeploy the frontend if necessary

## Maintenance

- Monitor the application through Digital Ocean dashboard
- Update the codebase through GitHub and let CI/CD handle deployment
- Backup data regularly

## Troubleshooting

- Check application logs in Digital Ocean dashboard
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Ensure API endpoints are properly configured
