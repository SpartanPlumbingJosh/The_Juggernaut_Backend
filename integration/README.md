# Integration & Project Management

This component is responsible for coordinating the overall development effort, integrating all components, and managing the deployment of the Elite AI Assistant.

## Responsibilities

- Coordinate overall development efforts
- Integrate components from other teams
- Manage deployment to Digital Ocean
- Ensure all components work together seamlessly
- Implement the API gateway for component communication

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `integration` directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the integration server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Technical Stack

- **API Gateway**: Express.js or FastAPI
- **Integration Testing**: Jest, Pytest, or Supertest
- **Project Management**: GitHub Projects
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Implementation Guidelines

### API Gateway

Implement a unified API gateway that routes requests to appropriate components:

- RESTful endpoints for all components
- WebSocket support for real-time communication
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation

### Component Integration

Ensure all components work together seamlessly:

- Define clear API contracts between components
- Implement adapter patterns for component communication
- Create integration tests for all component interactions
- Handle error cases and fallbacks

### Deployment Management

Coordinate the deployment of all components:

- Create unified deployment scripts
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Configure environment variables for different environments
- Manage secrets and credentials

### Project Coordination

Facilitate collaboration between teams:

- Track development progress
- Identify and resolve integration issues
- Ensure consistent coding standards
- Maintain comprehensive documentation

## Development Timeline

1. **Day 1-3**: Set up API gateway and basic integration
2. **Day 4-7**: Implement integration tests for initial components
3. **Day 8-10**: Coordinate component integration as they become available
4. **Day 11-14**: Finalize integration and prepare for deployment
