# Autonomous & Self-Improvement System

This component is responsible for implementing the self-improvement and autonomous capabilities of the Elite AI Assistant.

## Responsibilities

- Develop Auto-GPT inspired self-improvement mechanisms
- Implement code generation and modification capabilities
- Create learning systems to improve from interactions
- Build task planning and execution systems
- Enable autonomous operation and decision-making

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `autonomous` directory
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Custom Auto-GPT inspired architecture
- **Language Models**: Code generation capabilities
- **Learning Systems**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback
- **Task Planning**: Goal-oriented task decomposition
- **Execution**: Sandboxed code execution environment

## Implementation Guidelines

### Self-Improvement Mechanisms

Implement systems that allow the AI to improve itself:

- Performance monitoring to track effectiveness
- Learning from successful and unsuccessful interactions
- Capability expansion by adding new skills and knowledge
- Self-modification of its own codebase

### Code Generation & Modification

Create capabilities for the AI to generate and modify code:

- Python module generation for new functionality
- Self-updating code with proper testing
- Plugin development for specialized tasks
- Safe execution environment for generated code

### Task Planning & Execution

Build systems for autonomous operation:

- Goal management for setting and refining objectives
- Task planning to break down complex goals
- Execution engine to carry out tasks with appropriate tools
- Feedback loop to learn from execution results

### API Endpoints

The autonomous system will expose these primary endpoints:

- `/improve`: Endpoints for self-improvement operations
- `/generate`: Code and content generation endpoints
- `/execute`: Task execution endpoints
- `/learn`: Learning system endpoints

See the API contracts in `docs/api-contracts.md` for detailed specifications.
