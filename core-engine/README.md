# Core Conversational Engine

This component is responsible for implementing the advanced language processing capabilities of the Elite AI Assistant.

## Responsibilities

- Implement LangChain-based conversation system
- Develop advanced context management
- Create memory systems for long-term recall
- Build unrestricted response capabilities
- Handle natural language understanding and generation

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `core-engine` directory
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: LangChain, FastAPI
- **Language Models**: Integration with various LLMs
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or Weaviate for knowledge storage
- **Memory**: Custom memory systems for context retention
- **API**: RESTful and WebSocket endpoints

## Implementation Guidelines

### Language Processing

The core engine should provide advanced language processing with minimal restrictions:

- Multiple LLM support with fallback mechanisms
- Advanced context window handling for extended conversations
- Minimal content filtering for maximum flexibility
- Multi-step reasoning with self-critique capabilities

### Memory Systems

Implement sophisticated memory systems for enhanced conversation capabilities:

- Short-term conversation memory
- Long-term vectorized knowledge storage
- Episodic memory for learning from past interactions

### API Endpoints

The core engine will expose these primary endpoints:

- `/chat`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time conversation
- `/message`: REST endpoint for single message exchanges
- `/memory`: Endpoints for memory management
- `/settings`: Configuration endpoints

See the API contracts in `docs/api-contracts.md` for detailed specifications.

## Development Timeline

1. **Day 1-3**: Set up project structure and basic LangChain integration
2. **Day 4-7**: Implement memory systems and context management
3. **Day 8-10**: Build API endpoints and WebSocket support
4. **Day 11-14**: Integrate with frontend and optimize performance
